# Modding Guide: Modding Basics

## Using Mods

If you're an end user looking to learn how to install a mod, see the page [Add and Configure Mods](/docs/adding-mods).

## Developing Mods

Enigma Engine is home to a powerful and useful tool known as ModCore. ModCore makes it easy to append, replace, or merge files without editing the game's code.

Enigma Engine's ModCore is powered by [Polymod](https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod). Polymod is what handles loading the relevant assets, ensuring they are injected properly. It also handles ensuring mods are loaded in the proper order. The basic premise is that mods within the `mods` folder of your Enigma Engine install will be automatically loaded into the game.

Currently, ModCore allows users to do the following:
* Install and uninstall mods as easily as moving them into and out of the `mods` folder (with a mod menu coming soon).
* Replace any existing assets (including graphics, song data, or audio files).
* Add new assets, which the engine will detect and load automatically.
* Append to or modify files without breaking mods that overlap.

This page has a quick breakdown on how to make a basic mod, along with a more detailed explanation and some pro tips. If you're looking to skip past the nitty gritty, simply f

### Creating an Mod

The creation of every mod starts with these steps:

1. Create a folder. The name should be lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes. You'll be able to specify a full title with symbols and stuff later.
    * If you downloaded Enigma Engine from the link above, place the mod folder within the `mods` directory next to `Enigma Engine.exe`.
    * If you're building Enigma Engine from source
        * Pro tip, if you're just making a basic mod, or even a more complex mod, you shouldn't need to modify the source or rebuild the game! Just download the game and put your content into the `mods` folder.
2. Create a `mod.json` file inside your newly created mod folder. Paste in the following content, modifying the title, description, and author as necessary.

```
{
	"title":"Example Mod",
	"description":"This is an example mod!",
	"author":"Foobar",
	"api_version":"0.1.0",
	"mod_version":"1.0.0",
	"license":"CC BY 4.0,MIT"
}
```

 in the `mods` folder of your Enigma Engine install

### Metadata

You will want several pieces of metadata in order for Enigma Engine to identify and display your mod. Only `_polymod_meta.json` is mandatory, while other mods are recommended.

* `_polymod_meta.json`
  * This file tells Polymod all about your mod, such as name and description. This file is **MANDATORY**.
  * Learn more about how to write this file below.
* `_polymod_icon.png`
  * This icon will be used by mod browsers in the future. Make sure to provide one, 256x256 should be pretty good.
* `LICENSE.txt`
  * This is the general sofware license used by the mod. Without a license, your mod is under All Rights Reserved.
* `ASSET_LICENSE.txt`
  * This is the license specifically for the mod's assets.
  * Creative Commons is recommended.
* `CODE_LICENSE.txt` (for code/script-specific licensing terms.
  * GPLv3, Apache, or MIT are recommended.
* `_polymod_pack.txt`
  * Used for modpacks.

### _polymod_meta.json

Here is an example of a valid mod metadata file.

Note that both `api_version` and `mod_version` should use valid [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) values.

```
{
	"title":"Daisy",
	"description":"This mod has a daisy",
	"author":"Lars A. Doucet",
	"api_version":"0.1.0",
	"mod_version":"1.0.0-alpha",
	"license":"CC BY 4.0,MIT"
}
```

* `title`, `description`, `author`, and `license` should be self-explanatory. Be sure to put good values here as they will eventually be displayed in the mod menu.
* `mod_version` should be a version number that you set, and increment every time the mod changes.
* `api_version` is a version set by Enigma Engine. This uses Semantic Versioning; one or more breaking changes that will require fixes in existing mods (which should happen very rarely and will include a migration guide here on the wiki) will increment the major version, feature additions that don't break existing mods will increment the minor version, and backwards compatible bug fix changes and tweaks will increment the patch version. If the API version you specify in your mod is not compatible, Enigma Engine will not load it.

## Assets

You can create complex and elaborate mods simply by adding the relevant assets to your mod folder. By adding song data files to the `data/songs` folder, the game will be able to detect and load them if you add the relevant data to the `weeks`

### Adding and Replacing

Asset additions and replacements are simple; just place the assets in the relevant subfolder.

Here's what the mod folder might look like for a simple "XXX over Boyfriend" mod.

```
<modRoot> (name this anything)
|- _polymod_meta.json
|- images
  |- characters
    |- BOYFRIEND.xml
    |- BOYFRIEND.png
|- data
  |- characters
    |- boyfriend.json
```

Some tips:

* The folder structure corresponds with that used by the [game's asset folder](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/EnigmaEngine/tree/stable/assets). Assets which go into the `preload` folder are instead moved up to the mod root folder but otherwise the structure remains the same.
  * Check out a real example at [ENA Skin Pack for ModCore](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/ModCore-ENA-Skin-Pack/)
* Assets which share the same name as assets already in the game will replace those assets.
* Song files have been moved into a subdirectory at `data/songs/<songname>` rather than being in `data/<songname>`. As long as you place the song in the CORRECT subdirectory, the game will automatically detect it.
* Code for adding new characters has been abstracted to read from a file in `data/characters/
* Data files which are new and do not share the same name as an existing asset (such as new song files in `data/songs` will be readable by the game as long as you add them to Free Play or a custom week; see the [Appending](#Appending) section below.

### Appending

Appending to assets is only slightly more involved. Appending is used when you want to add to the end of a particular text file without getting rid of what's already there.

For example, using the above method on `introText.txt` will get rid of the base game's intro text values, as well as any that other mods may have added. This may or may not be what you want. Appending will put your values at the end of the file for other mods to add to.

To perform asset appending, place the assets in the relevant subfolder under the `_append` folder, like so. Note the underscore before it.

```
<modRoot> (name this anything)
|- _polymod_meta.json
|- _append
  |- data
    |- introText.txt
    |- freeplaySonglist.txt
```

Some tips:

* `freeplaySonglist.txt` now uses song IDs (aka the name of the song directory, which has no spaces or symbols) to identify the songs in Free Play and the order they appear.
* If you use the `Adding and Replacing` method above to add a new song to the game, it won't appear in the Free Play song list unless you append its ID, character icon, and week number to `freeplaySonglist.txt`.

### Merging

Merging is the most powerful yet the most convoluted method. Use it only if you can't use replacement or appending.

Merging locates a given key in a file and replaces it with the intended value.

* For `CSV` and `TSV` files, the value in the first column is assumed to be the ID. Each ID in the merge CSV is located in the base CSV, and that row is replaced with the row from the merge CSV.
* For `LINES` text files, Polymod will use the first line as the pattern to check for, it will look it, and insert the other lines of the merge file after that one, before continuing with the rest of the file. `.txt` files use the `LINES` format by default. For example, if the base file reads:
```
ABC
DEF
GHI
```
And the merge file reads:
```
DEF
123
```
The merged file will look like:
```
ABC
DEF
123
GHI
```
* For `PLAINTEXT` text files, Polymod will throw a warning that merging is not supported.
* For `XML` files, you need to add a child key called `merge` which specifies the key and value to match on. All other values will be replaced. [See here for more info](https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod#_merge-folder).
* For `JSON` files, create a single top-level array named `merge`. Each element is an object with two keys: A key `target` like `abc.d[3].e`, and a value to insert `payload`. [See here for more info](https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod#_merge-folder).

## Modpacks

To create a modpack, make a mod containing a `_polymod_pack.txt` file with the following text:

```
foo:1.0.0,bar:1.*.*,abc,xyz
```

ModCore will search for, and load, the mods with the IDs `foo`, `bar`, `abc`, and `xyz`, in that order. It will fail any mods that fail the version check (`foo` must be exactly `1.0.0` while `bar` allows any `1.x` version) and only load the mods which don't fail.

## Distributing Mods

The ideal means of distributing a mod is by creating a mod folder and distributing it, so that users can download Enigma Engine and install the mod themselves (or, in the future, use a tool that helps them do that).

However, if you are still set on distributing your mod as a standalone executable, here are the steps to follow for that:

* Follow the guide at [Building Enigma Engine](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/EnigmaEngine/wiki/building-enigma-engine) and clone the `stable` branch.
* Develop your mod using the standard method with the mods folder, since that has better debugging.
* Go to `Enigma.hx` and change the static variable `ENABLE_MODS` to false. This disables all of the behavior related to mods without having to perform messy code cleanup.
* Install your mod data directly into the `assets` folder. Add any files you want to add, replace any files you want to replace, directly modify or append any files you want to change.
  * Remember that main menu assets and song charts go into the `preload` directory.
* If you want to remove the basic weeks, modify `data/freeplaySongList` to remove them from free play, and modify the week data file to remove those weeks from story mode.
  * You can also delete any files in `music`, data files in `data/songs`, or asset files that you know are only used by those weeks.
* Build, test, and distribute that.

Although this method of creating mods is not the preferred method (ideally you can distribute mods in both formats for the purposes of forwards compatibility) it is still officially endorsed, and you may create issues and bug reports related to it.
